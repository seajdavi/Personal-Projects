<p>This is a collection of non-academic projects Iâ€™ve worked on independently outside of school.  These were all created with Python 3.</p>

<h3>ISS Location</h3>
<p>Tracks the latitude and longitude of the International Space Station and displays it over a world map.</p>


<h3>Playoff Goals</h3>
<p>Creates a graph that shows when all overtime goals have been scored in the NHL Playoffs since the 2005-2006 season.
It was initially created as a Jupyter file, but I also uploaded it as a regular Python file so it can be opened if you don't have Jupyter.
<br>*This downloads the webpage the data comes from and saves it as a file called playoff-goals*</p>

<h3>Song Hangman</h3>
<p>A text based game similar to hangman that selects a random song from your iTunes library for the player to guess.  In order for it to work, you have to change 2 things in the code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign the variable called path at the top of the file to the location of your iTunes music folder.</li>
<li>Call the function SongAdder with any artist in your iTunes library that you want included in the game.  This is at the bottom of the file in the function called Initialize.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stocks</h3>
<p>Uses Yahoo Finance to show the stock details of specified companies.  There is a list called companies in the code that holds the symbols of certain companies.  Alter this list to show the info of other companies.</p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>Finds your location based on your IP address and uses a weather API to get the current weather of that location.</p>
