<h2>Playoff Goals</h2>
<p>Creates a graph that shows when all overtime goals have been scored in the NHL Playoffs since the 2005-2006 season.
It was initially created as a Jupyter file, but I also uploaded it as a regular Python file so it can be opened if you don't have Jupyter.</p>

<h2>Song Hangman</h2>
<p>A text based game similar to hangman that selects a random song from your iTunes library for the player to guess.  In order for it to work, you have to change 2 things in the code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign the variable called ‘path’ at the top of the file to the location of your iTunes music folder.</li>
<li>Call the function SongAdder with any artist in your iTunes library that you want included in the game.  This is at the bottom of the file in the function called Initialize.</li>
</ol>
